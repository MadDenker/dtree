Dtree_pd - A Python decision tree using Pandas DataFrames
=================================================================

Overview
--------

Given a training data set, it constructs a decision tree for classification or
regression recursively.  

It accepts data in a python Pandas DataFrame format.

The module is loosely based on code published by Christopher Roach in his
article [Building Decision Trees in Python](http://onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2006/02/09/ai_decision_trees.html).
